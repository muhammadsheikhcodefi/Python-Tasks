if (ticket and passport) or VIP_Passenger:
  print("Boarding Allowed")
else:
  print("Boarding Denied")
  

'''Task 5 — Insurance Premium Offer

age between 25 and 50 (inclusive) and health_score > 70
OR the person has chosen a premium plan.
Print 'Premium Offered' or 'Premium Not Offered'.'''

age = int(input("whts your age: "))
health_score = int(input("whts your health score: "))
premium_plan = input("did you choose premium plan? (Yes/No) \n").strip().lower() == "yes"

if (25 <= age <=50 and health_score > 70) or premium_plan:
  print("Premium Offered")
else:
  print("Premium Not Offered")
  
  
'''Task 6 — Exam Retake Decision
Write a Python program to check if a student must retake the exam. Retake if:

marks < 40 and attendance < 70
OR the student missed the final exam.
Print 'Retake Required' or 'No Retake Needed'.'''

marks = int(input("Whats your Marks: "))
attendance = int(input("Whats your attendance: "))
finals = input("Did you missed your finals? (Yes/No) \n").strip().lower() != "no"

if (marks < 40 and attendance < 70) or finals:
  print('Retake Required')
else:
  print('No Retake Needed')
